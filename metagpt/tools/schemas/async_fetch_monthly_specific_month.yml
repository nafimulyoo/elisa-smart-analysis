  for phase T. (kWh) - "daily_data": A list of dictionaries, each containing: - "timestamp":
  The timestamp for the data point in ''YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'' format. - "cost": The
  cost for the day. (Rupiah) - "energy": The energy consumption for the day. (kWh)
  - "phase 1": Energy consumption for phase 1 (R). (kWh) - "phase 2": Energy consumption
  for phase 2 (S). (kWh) - "phase 3": Energy consumption for phase 3 (T). (kWh) -
  "month_data": A dictionary containing: - "total_daya": Total energy consumption
  for the month. (kWh) - "avg_daya": Average energy consumption per day. (kWh/day)
  - "total_cost": Total cost for the month. (Rupiah) - "avg_cost": Average cost per
  day. (Rupiah/day) - "prev_month_data": A dictionary containing: - "total_daya":
