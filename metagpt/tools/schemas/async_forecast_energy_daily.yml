description: 'Forecast daily energy usage data for a specific faculty, building, and
  floor for the next specified days. The forecast is based on historical data and
  uses the Prophet model for time series forecasting. Energy usage in kWh. Only get
  the history if user wanted it. '
signature: '(faculty: str = '''', building: str = '''', floor: str = '''', days_to_forecast:
  int = 30)'
parameters: 'Args: faculty (str, optional): Filter by faculty code (e.g., ''FTI'').
  building (str, optional): Filter by building code (e.g., ''LABTEK IV''). floor (str,
  optional): Filter by floor code (e.g., ''LANTAI 1''). days_to_forecast (int, optional):
  Number of days to forecast ahead. Default is 7. Returns: tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]:
  A tuple containing two pandas DataFrames: - The first DataFrame contains historical
  energy usage data with ''datetime'' and ''energy_usage'' columns. The date time
  is in ''YYYY-MM-DD'' format. - The second DataFrame contains forecasted energy usage
  data with ''datetime'', ''predicted_energy_usage'', ''predicted_energy_lower'',
  and ''predicted_energy_upper'' columns. The date time is in ''YYYY-MM-DD'' format.
  Raises: Exception: If the API request fails. Example: history_df, forecast_df =
  forecast_energy_daily(faculty="FTI", building="LABTEK IV", days_to_forecast=7)'
