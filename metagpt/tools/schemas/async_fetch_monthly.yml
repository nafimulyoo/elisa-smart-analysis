description: 'Fetch monthly energy and cost data for a specific month. '
signature: '(date: str, faculty: str = '''', building: str = '''', floor: str = '''')'
parameters: 'Args: date (str): The month and year in ''YYYY-MM'' format. faculty (str,
  optional): Filter by faculty code (e.g., ''FTI''). building (str, optional): Filter
  by building code (e.g., ''LABTEK IV''). floor (str, optional): Filter by floor code
  (e.g., ''LANTAI 1''). Returns: dict: A dictionary containing the following keys:
  - "chart_data": A list of dictionaries, each containing: - "timestamp": The timestamp
  for the data point. - "R": Energy consumption for phase R. - "S": Energy consumption
  for phase S. - "T": Energy consumption for phase T. - "daily_data": A list of dictionaries,
  each containing: - "timestamp": The timestamp for the data point. - "cost": The
  cost for the day. - "energy": The energy consumption for the day. - "phase 1": Energy
  consumption for phase 1. - "phase 2": Energy consumption for phase 2. - "phase 3":
  Energy consumption for phase 3. - "month_data": A dictionary containing: - "total_daya":
  Total energy consumption for the month. - "avg_daya": Average energy consumption
  per day. - "total_cost": Total cost for the month. - "avg_cost": Average cost per
  day. - "prev_month_data": A dictionary containing the same keys as "month_data"
  for the previous month.'
