ITB Energy wastage identification

Elisa is an online monitoring system designed to track the usage of electricity and water, helping users build awareness of energy efficiency and cost-saving potential. It collects and analyzes real-time data on energy consumption across different buildings and faculties, offering insights into daily, monthly, and real-time electricity usage. The system integrates IoT technology and features a digital power meter to measure electrical parameters such as current, voltage, and power. The data is transmitted using a Modbus protocol to a server, allowing users to access and analyze energy data remotely. Elisa’s dashboard offers features like daily and monthly consumption summaries, energy distribution heatmaps, and comparisons between faculties. It also enables users to monitor energy balance in three-phase systems, providing valuable information for optimizing energy management and reducing operational costs.
The ELISA (Energy and Water Monitoring System) at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) is an IoT-based monitoring system designed to track real-time energy and water consumption across various campus buildings. ELISA records energy parameters such as current, voltage, and power, then transmits this data to a central dashboard. Through this dashboard, ITB can observe daily and monthly energy consumption patterns, identify peak usage times, and implement targeted energy-saving measures.

Through the ELISA dashboard, ITB can accurately measure the total volume of energy and water usage across the university. This includes real-time monitoring of power consumption, electrical current, and voltage over specific periods, such as the last hour. Users can track daily and monthly energy patterns, enabling efficient energy management and planning. The system’s heatmap feature highlights peak consumption times, categorizing energy use into High, Medium, and Low intensities. Additionally, ELISA allows for comparative analysis between buildings and faculties, helping ITB optimize energy efficiency based on specific metrics such as building size and student population

Energy Wastage Identification from Elisa System
With data from ELISA, ITB can identify high energy-consuming units or areas, such as FTMD, and focus on these areas for the implementation of energy efficiency measures. This monitoring not only helps ITB prioritize energy-intensive areas but also enables proactive steps to reduce energy consumption across the campus, supporting ITB’s commitment to sustainable energy management.
